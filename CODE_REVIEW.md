# Code Review

## Engineer Review
- `ruff check . --fix` shows no linting errors.
- `bandit -r src -q` reports no security issues.
- `pytest -q` executes all sprint tests successfully (`10 passed`).
- The code follows a simple architecture with dataclass models, a TFâ€‘IDF QA engine, EDGAR client, and CLI utility.
- No major performance problems are apparent for small inputs; heavy network calls are done via `requests`.

## Product Manager Review
- The sprint board marks tasks for citation tracking and CLI display as Done.
- Acceptance criteria in `tests/sprint_acceptance_criteria.json` cover the citation model, anchor extraction, QA citation attachment, and CLI command.
- The implemented modules (`citation.py`, `qa_engine.py`, `cli.py`) satisfy these tests with proper error handling.
- CLI demonstrates question answering over local text files and prints citations.

Overall the implementation meets the planned functionality and passes all checks.
