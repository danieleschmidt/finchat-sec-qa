# FinChat-SEC-QA Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: FinChat-SEC-QA  
**Version**: 1.4.9  
**Project Type**: Open Source Financial Analysis RAG Agent  
**Status**: Active Development  

## Problem Statement

Financial professionals and analysts need efficient access to information contained in SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) with reliable source attribution for regulatory compliance and decision-making. Traditional methods of searching through these documents are time-consuming and prone to missing critical information.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- RAG-based question answering system for SEC filings
- Citation-anchored responses with precise source attribution
- Multi-interface access (CLI, REST API, Web UI, Python SDK)
- Real-time EDGAR integration with automated filing retrieval
- Risk intelligence and sentiment analysis of financial passages
- Multi-company comparative analysis capabilities
- Voice interface for accessibility
- Comprehensive testing and performance monitoring

### Out of Scope
- Financial advice or investment recommendations
- Real-time market data integration
- Trading execution capabilities
- Non-SEC financial document processing
- Personal financial management features

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Accurate extraction and processing of 10-K/10-Q filings
- [ ] Citation accuracy of 95%+ for source attribution
- [ ] Response time under 3 seconds for typical queries
- [ ] Support for 500+ companies in the system
- [ ] 99.5% uptime for production deployments

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥ 85%
- [ ] Security score â‰¥ 90%
- [ ] Documentation coverage â‰¥ 88%
