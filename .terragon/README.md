# Terragon Autonomous SDLC Enhancement System

This directory contains the **Terragon Perpetual Value Discovery Engine** - an advanced autonomous system for continuous SDLC improvement and value optimization.

## üéØ System Overview

The Terragon system implements a sophisticated autonomous SDLC enhancement framework that:

- **Continuously discovers** high-value work items from multiple sources
- **Intelligently prioritizes** tasks using advanced composite scoring (WSJF + ICE + Technical Debt)
- **Autonomously executes** improvements with comprehensive safety guardrails
- **Continuously learns** from outcomes to improve future predictions
- **Adapts dynamically** to repository maturity and changing conditions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Run Value Discovery

```bash
# Single discovery run
./.terragon/autonomous-execution.sh discovery

# Continuous discovery (5 cycles)
./.terragon/autonomous-execution.sh continuous 5

# Full cycle (discovery + execution + learning)
./.terragon/autonomous-execution.sh full-cycle
```

### 2. View Discovered Items

Check the automatically generated backlog:
```bash
cat TERRAGON_VALUE_BACKLOG.md
```

### 3. Setup Scheduled Execution

```bash
# Generate cron templates
./.terragon/autonomous-execution.sh setup-cron

# Review the generated schedule
cat .terragon/cron-setup.txt
```

## üß† How It Works

### Multi-Source Signal Harvesting

The system continuously monitors multiple data sources:

1. **Git History Analysis**
   - Commit message patterns (TODO, FIXME, hack, temporary)
   - Code churn vs. complexity correlation
   - Bus factor and knowledge concentration analysis

2. **Static Code Analysis** 
   - Complexity metrics (cyclomatic, cognitive, maintainability)
   - Code quality violations and patterns
   - Architecture debt accumulation

3. **Security Analysis**
   - Vulnerability scanning and CVE monitoring
   - Dependency security assessments
   - Security pattern violations

4. **Performance Analysis**
   - Runtime performance regression detection
   - Memory usage patterns and optimizations
   - Load testing results and bottlenecks

5. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Available updates and security patches
   - Breaking change impact assessment
   - License and compliance considerations

### Advanced Composite Scoring

Each discovered work item receives a sophisticated composite score:

#### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
```
WSJF = (User/Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk/Opportunity) / Job Size
```

- **User/Business Value**: Direct impact on users and business metrics
- **Time Criticality**: Urgency and cost of delay  
- **Risk/Opportunity**: Risk mitigation and opportunity enablement
- **Job Size**: Estimated effort required (inverse relationship)

#### ICE (Impact √ó Confidence √ó Ease)
```  
ICE = Impact √ó Confidence √ó Ease
```

- **Impact**: Expected business/technical improvement
- **Confidence**: Certainty in the impact estimate
- **Ease**: Implementation complexity and effort

#### Technical Debt Scoring
```
Technical Debt = (Debt Impact + Debt Interest) √ó Hotspot Multiplier
```

- **Debt Impact**: Maintenance hours that would be saved
- **Debt Interest**: Future cost if not addressed (compounds over time)
- **Hotspot Multiplier**: Based on code churn and complexity correlation

#### Final Composite Score
```
Composite = W‚ÇÅ√óWSJF + W‚ÇÇ√óICE + W‚ÇÉ√óTechnicalDebt + Category Boosts
```

Where weights (W‚ÇÅ, W‚ÇÇ, W‚ÇÉ) adapt based on repository maturity level.

### Continuous Learning Engine

The system improves its predictions through:

- **Outcome Tracking**: Comparing predicted vs. actual impact and effort
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying similar work item characteristics  
- **Model Calibration**: Adjusting scoring weights based on historical accuracy
- **Confidence Scoring**: Learning when estimates are reliable vs. uncertain

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Scoring Weights (value-config.yaml)

```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    advanced:  # For repositories with 75%+ SDLC maturity
      wsjf: 0.5              # Business impact focus
      ice: 0.1               # Reduced emphasis on ease
      technicalDebt: 0.3     # High debt reduction focus  
      security: 0.1          # Security multiplier baseline
```

### Quality Thresholds

```yaml
execution:
  testRequirements:
    minCoverage: 80         # Minimum test coverage
    performanceRegression: 5 # Max % performance loss
  rollbackTriggers:
    - testFailure
    - buildFailure
    - securityViolation
```

### Discovery Sources

```yaml
discovery:
  sources:
    - gitHistory            # Commit pattern analysis
    - staticAnalysis        # Code quality metrics
    - issueTrackers        # GitHub/Jira integration
    - vulnerabilityDatabases # CVE/security advisory monitoring
    - performanceMonitoring # Runtime metrics
```

## üìä Metrics and Reporting

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Value Delivery Rate**: Business value delivered per unit time
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Percentage reduction in maintenance burden
- **Security Posture**: Improvement in security metrics and vulnerability counts
- **Performance Gains**: Measurable performance improvements achieved
- **Prediction Accuracy**: How well the system estimates effort and impact

### Continuous Metrics (value-metrics.json)

```json
{
  "continuousMetrics": {
    "totalItemsCompleted": 89,
    "averageCycleTimeHours": 3.2,
    "valueDeliveredScore": 4250,

    "adaptationCycles": 15
  }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety and Guardrails

### Autonomous Execution Safety

1. **Test-Driven Safety**: All changes must maintain test coverage thresholds
2. **Performance Protection**: Automatic rollback on performance regression
3. **Security Validation**: All changes pass security scanning
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Phased implementation with validation at each step
5. **Human Override**: Manual intervention capabilities at all stages

### Risk Management

- **Risk Scoring**: Each item receives a risk assessment before execution
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Low confidence items require human review
- **Rollback Automation**: Automatic reversion on failure detection
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all autonomous actions

## üîÑ Integration with Existing SDLC

### GitHub Integration

The system integrates seamlessly with existing GitHub workflows:

- **PR Creation**: Automatic pull request generation with detailed context
