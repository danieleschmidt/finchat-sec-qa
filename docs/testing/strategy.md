- **Data**: Minimal synthetic datasets

### CI/CD Environment
- **Purpose**: Automated testing on code changes
- **Setup**: GitHub Actions with containerized services
- **Data**: Reproducible test datasets

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production validation
- **Setup**: Production-like infrastructure
- **Data**: Sanitized production-like data

### Performance Testing Environment
- **Purpose**: Load and performance testing
- **Setup**: Scaled infrastructure matching production
- **Data**: Large synthetic datasets
