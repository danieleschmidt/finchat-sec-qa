# Requirements Specification

## Project Charter

### Problem Statement
Financial analysts and researchers need efficient access to SEC filing information (10-K, 10-Q) with precise citation tracking and risk assessment capabilities. Manual analysis of lengthy financial documents is time-consuming and error-prone.

### Solution Overview
FinChat-SEC-QA provides an AI-powered RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that:
- Automatically ingests SEC filings via EDGAR API
- Enables natural language queries with citation-anchored responses
- Performs risk intelligence analysis with sentiment scoring
- Supports multi-company comparative analysis

### Success Criteria
- **Performance**: Query response time < 5 seconds for 95% of requests
- **Accuracy**: Citation accuracy rate > 90% in manual validation
- **Coverage**: Support for all major SEC filing types (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)
- **Reliability**: System uptime > 99.5% during market hours
- **Security**: Zero exposure of sensitive API keys or user data

### Scope

#### In Scope
- SEC EDGAR API integration with rate limiting
- Natural language question answering with RAG pipeline
- Citation tracking with precise source attribution
- Risk sentiment analysis and flagging
- Multi-interface support (CLI, API, Web, SDK)
- Voice output capability
- Multi-company analysis features

#### Out of Scope
- Real-time market data integration
- Investment advice or recommendations
- Non-SEC document types
- Historical data beyond EDGAR availability
- Financial modeling or calculations
