# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a way to document significant architectural decisions made in the FinChat-SEC-QA project to maintain historical context and reasoning for future team members and stakeholders.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following the format:
- Title with incremental numbering
- Status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- Context (situation and problem)
- Decision (chosen solution)
- Consequences (positive and negative outcomes)

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Historical context for future changes
- Improved onboarding for new team members
- Better decision-making process

### Negative
- Additional documentation overhead
- Requires discipline to maintain
- May slow down rapid prototyping

## Notes
ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/` with format `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`
