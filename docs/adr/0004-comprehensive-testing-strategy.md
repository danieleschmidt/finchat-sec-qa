# ADR-0004: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The FinChat-SEC-QA system requires a robust testing strategy to ensure reliability, security, and performance across multiple interfaces (CLI, API, Web, SDK). Given the financial nature of the application, testing must cover accuracy, security, and regulatory compliance requirements.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered testing strategy with the following components:

### 1. Unit Testing (Target: 85% coverage)
- **Framework**: pytest with pytest-cov for coverage
- **Scope**: Individual functions and classes
- **Focus**: Business logic, data processing, validation
- **Tools**: pytest-mock for mocking external dependencies

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Framework**: pytest with custom fixtures
- **Scope**: Component interactions, API endpoints, database operations
- **Focus**: EDGAR API integration, vector database operations, caching layer
- **Environment**: Docker containers for isolated testing

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- **Framework**: pytest with real SEC filings
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows from CLI and web interface
- **Focus**: Full pipeline testing from ingestion to query response
- **Data**: Sanitized production-like test datasets

### 4. Performance Testing
- **Framework**: pytest-benchmark and k6 for load testing
- **Scope**: Query response times, concurrent user handling, memory usage
- **Targets**: < 5s response time, 100 concurrent users
- **Monitoring**: Resource usage and bottleneck identification

### 5. Security Testing
- **Framework**: bandit for static analysis, custom security tests
- **Scope**: Input validation, authentication, data encryption
- **Focus**: OWASP Top 10, financial data security standards
- **Tools**: Safety for dependency vulnerability scanning

### 6. Contract Testing
- **Framework**: Custom API contract validation
- **Scope**: SDK client compatibility, API version consistency
- **Focus**: Breaking change detection, backward compatibility
- **Implementation**: JSON schema validation, response format verification

### 7. Mutation Testing
- **Framework**: mutmut for test quality assessment
- **Scope**: Critical business logic paths
- **Focus**: Test effectiveness measurement
- **Schedule**: Weekly execution on CI/CD pipeline

```

## Test Data Management
- **Sample Filings**: Curated set of real SEC filings for testing (anonymized)
- **Mock Responses**: Standardized API responses for unit testing
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data with factory patterns
- **Environment Variables**: Separate test configuration

## Quality Gates
- **Unit Tests**: Must pass with 85% coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests**: All critical paths must pass
- **Security Tests**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Performance Tests**: Response time and throughput targets met
- **Mutation Score**: >70% for critical business logic

## CI/CD Integration
- **Pre-commit**: Fast unit tests and linting
- **Pull Request**: Full test suite execution
- **Staging**: Performance and security test validation
- **Production**: Smoke tests and health checks post-deployment

## Rationale
This comprehensive approach ensures:
1. **Quality Assurance**: Multi-layered validation catches issues early
2. **Security**: Financial applications require robust security testing
3. **Performance**: User experience depends on response time guarantees
4. **Maintainability**: Clear test organization supports team collaboration
5. **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements demand thorough testing

## Alternatives Considered
- **Single-layer testing**: Insufficient for financial application complexity
- **Manual testing only**: Not scalable for continuous deployment
- **External testing services**: Cost-prohibitive and less customizable

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Higher confidence in releases, faster issue detection, better security posture
- **Negative**: Increased CI/CD pipeline execution time, additional maintenance overhead
- **Mitigation**: Parallel test execution, selective test running based on changes

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Unit and integration test framework setup
- **Phase 2** (Week 3-4): End-to-end and performance test implementation
- **Phase 3** (Week 5-6): Security and contract testing integration
- **Phase 4** (Week 7-8): Mutation testing and optimization
