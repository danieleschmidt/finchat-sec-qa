# ADR-0003: Async Architecture for I/O Operations

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The original synchronous implementation blocked threads during SEC API calls and file operations, limiting concurrency and user experience. With multiple users querying simultaneously, this became a performance bottleneck.

## Decision
Implement async/await patterns for all I/O operations:
- EDGAR API client using httpx
- File operations where possible
- FastAPI endpoints with async handlers
- Concurrent query processing

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved throughput under concurrent load
- Better resource utilization
- Non-blocking user experience
- Scalable to 100+ concurrent users

### Negative
- Increased code complexity
- Async propagation through call stack
- Additional testing complexity
- Learning curve for synchronous codebases

## Implementation Notes
- Created `AsyncEdgarClient` alongside synchronous version
- Updated FastAPI endpoints to use async handlers
- Maintained backward compatibility with sync CLI interface
- Added async context managers for resource cleanup
