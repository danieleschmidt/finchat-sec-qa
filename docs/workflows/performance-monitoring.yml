# Performance Monitoring Workflow Documentation
# This documents requirements for continuous performance monitoring

name: Performance Monitoring
description: |
  Continuous performance monitoring and regression detection.
  Implements performance baselines and alerts on degradation.

# Required workflow implementation:
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM UTC

# Implementation requirements:
jobs:
  benchmark-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # 1. Run performance benchmarks
      - name: Execute performance benchmarks
        # Use pytest-benchmark for Python performance tests
        # Run benchmarks from tests/performance/
        # Generate baseline comparisons
      
      # 2. Memory profiling
      - name: Memory profiling
        # Use memory_profiler or similar tools
        # Check for memory leaks in long-running processes
        # Profile EDGAR client and QA engine performance
      
      # 3. Load testing
      - name: Load testing
        # Use k6 scripts from tests/performance/k6/
        # Test API endpoints under various loads
        # Measure response times and throughput
      
      # 4. Database performance (if applicable)
      - name: Database performance testing
        # Test query performance
        # Check index effectiveness
        # Measure connection pool performance

  performance-regression-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # 1. Compare against baseline
      - name: Performance regression analysis
        # Compare current benchmarks to stored baselines
        # Detect significant performance regressions
        # Generate performance diff reports
      
      # 2. Update performance baselines
      - name: Update performance baselines
        # Update baseline metrics for main branch
        # Store historical performance data
        # Generate performance trend reports

  resource-monitoring:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # 1. Monitor resource usage
      - name: Resource usage monitoring
        # Monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O during tests
        # Check for resource leaks
        # Validate resource cleanup
      
      # 2. Containerized performance testing
      - name: Docker performance testing
        # Test performance in containerized environment
        # Monitor container resource usage
        # Test multi-container deployment performance

# Performance thresholds:
# - API response time: < 500ms for 95th percentile
# - Memory usage: < 512MB for standard operations
# - EDGAR client: < 2s per filing retrieval
# - QA engine: < 5s per question processing
# - Load test: Handle 100 concurrent users

# Regression detection:
# - Fail build if performance degrades > 20%
# - Warning if performance degrades > 10%
# - Auto-create issue for performance regressions

# Integration requirements:
# - Store performance metrics in time-series database
# - Generate performance reports for each release
# - Alert on performance anomalies
# - Dashboard for performance trends

# Notification requirements:
# - Slack/email notifications for regressions
# - Weekly performance summary reports
# - Performance impact assessment for PRs
