# Advanced Dependency Update Workflow Documentation
# This documents requirements for automated dependency management

name: Dependency Updates

  Automated dependency updates with security scanning and testing.
  This workflow should be implemented to run weekly and create PRs for dependency updates.

# Required workflow implementation:
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1'  # Weekly on Monday at 6 AM UTC

# Implementation requirements:
jobs:
  update-python-deps:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # 1. Check for Python dependency updates
      - name: Update Python dependencies
        # Use pip-tools, poetry, or dependabot to check for updates
        # Generate updated requirements files
        # Create separate commits for each type of update (security, major, minor, patch)
      
      # 2. Security scanning of new dependencies
      - name: Security scan updated dependencies
        # Run safety, bandit, and semgrep on updated dependencies
        # Fail if critical vulnerabilities found
      
      # 3. Automated testing with new dependencies
      - name: Test with updated dependencies
        # Run full test suite including integration and security tests
        # Generate compatibility report
      
      # 4. Create categorized PRs
      - name: Create dependency update PRs
        # Create separate PRs for:
        # - Security updates (high priority)
        # - Major version updates (needs review)
        # - Minor/patch updates (auto-merge candidate)

  update-pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Update pre-commit hooks
      - name: Update pre-commit hooks
        # Run `pre-commit autoupdate`
        # Test hooks on sample files
        # Create PR if updates available

  update-github-actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps:
      # Update GitHub Actions to latest versions
      - name: Update GitHub Actions
        # Check for action updates
        # Update workflow files
        # Test updated workflows

# Security considerations:
# - All updates should be scanned for vulnerabilities
# - Critical security updates should be auto-merged after testing
# - Major version updates should require manual review
# - Failed tests should block merging

# Integration with existing CI:
# - Dependency update PRs should trigger full CI pipeline
# - Should respect branch protection rules
# - Should integrate with existing security scanning

# Notification requirements:
# - Failed dependency updates should notify maintainers
# - Security updates should have priority notifications
# - Weekly summary of dependency health should be generated
