# ðŸ”§ GitHub Workflows Setup Instructions

Due to GitHub App permissions, the advanced workflow files need to be added manually. Here are the workflow files that should be created:

## Required Workflow Files

### 1. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline
Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the enhanced configuration from the commit diff.

### 2. SLSA Provenance Workflow  
Create `.github/workflows/slsa-provenance.yml` with SLSA Level 3 compliance features.

### 3. Performance Monitoring Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/performance-monitoring.yml` for automated performance testing.

### 4. Chaos Engineering Workflow
Create `.github/workflows/chaos-engineering.yml` for resilience testing.

## Setup Steps

1. **Grant Workflow Permissions** (Repository Admin Required):
   - Go to repository Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
   - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

2. **Add Workflow Files**:
   - The workflow configurations are available in the commit history
   - Copy each workflow file content from the generated configurations
   - Create the files manually in the `.github/workflows/` directory

3. **Verify Setup**:
   - Push the workflow files to trigger the enhanced CI/CD pipeline
   - Check Actions tab to ensure workflows are running correctly

## Impact of Manual Setup

Once these workflow files are added:
- âœ… Multi-matrix testing across Python versions and OS platforms
- âœ… Advanced security scanning (CodeQL, Semgrep, Trivy)
- âœ… Automated performance monitoring and regression detection
- âœ… SLSA Level 3 supply chain security compliance
- âœ… Chaos engineering and resilience testing
- âœ… Semantic release automation

## Alternative: Pull Request Workflow

The enhanced configurations can also be added via a separate pull request once the appropriate permissions are granted to the GitHub App or when pushed by a user with workflow permissions.
